# Real-Time Raytracer (Work In Progress)

## Overview

This project is a **real-time ray tracing renderer** built with **C++**, **OpenGL**, and **GLFW**.  
It uses GPU compute shaders to accelerate ray tracing calculations, enabling interactive rendering of complex 3D scenes.  

A minimal **Dear ImGui** interface is integrated for debugging and user interaction.
